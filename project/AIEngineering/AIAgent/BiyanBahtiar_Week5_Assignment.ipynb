By Noah Johnson October 21, 2024 Michael Houtz; Photograph courtesy of Unlikely Save this story Save Save this story Save This is an edition of the weekly newsletter Pattern Grading, GQ global style director Noah Johnson’s no-holds-barred view on contemporary menswear, the culture of fashion, and how to get dressed now. Sign up here to get it free. Japan’s influence on menswear over the past several decades has been profound. At this stage, in fact, it’s practically to the point of cliché. Ask a cool guy who makes his cool pants. There’s a good chance they’re made by a Japanese brand you’ve never heard of. Even the phrase “Japanese brand” has become synonymous with something elite, ahead of the curve, and rarified. Perhaps annoyingly so. But not undeservingly. You can go back to the OGs. The great Kenzo Takada was the first Japanese designer to take his collection global, with a show in Paris in 1970. He was eventually followed by Comme des Garçons’s Rei Kawakubo , Issey Miyake , Yohji Yamamoto , and Undercover ’s Jun Takahashi. This cohort of visionary designers—extraordinary artists and skilled craftspeople, really—established a tradition of avant-garde and elegant Japanese high fashion that resounds today. Courtesy of A.Presse Courtesy of A.Presse The Official 2024 Sweater Power Rankings By Noah Johnson Style Advice Doesn't Matter Anymore By Noah Johnson In the 1990s, the Japanese fashion subculture explosion led to the global proliferation of a few enormous menswear trends—streetwear and sneaker culture, vintage workwear and military reproductions, and the everlasting, ever-present denim craze. That swirl of disparate but overlapping aesthetics began to evolve, then merge and refine into the first significant global Japanese menswear craze. By the late aughts, Visvim, Kapital , and Engineered Garments (an American brand owned by a Japanese company) were booming and being sold in stores around the world. That second wave rolled on for a while, with an enormous impact on what men buy and wear. Either as a result of this Japanese influence, or synchronistically in line with it, men started feeling a little more experimental with their wardrobe choices. They became more interested in how things fit and excited about the kind of small but significant details that made a brand like Engineered Garments really stand apart from, say, Banana Republic. Courtesy of Creek Angler's Device Courtesy of Creek Angler's Device A real boom in the global fashion market followed this shift. As a result, the international market for Japanese menswear began to open up slightly in the 2010s, but for smaller, less established brands the barriers to entry remained steep. Plus, the Japanese market was robust enough to support them. While Kapital and Visvim were able to figure out the global market, hundreds of small domestic labels were thriving without it. Building a global sales and distribution apparatus probably didn’t seem all that important. The yen was strong and Japan was seemingly full of niche fashion enthusiasts. Nevertheless, a third significant wave has emerged. These brands have a distinct Japanese sensibility, but without the obvious markings of the Japanese Brand. The detailing is subtle, the silhouettes are sophisticated, and they lack the traditional Japanese craft details—like boro cloth and shibori prints—that make brands like Kapital seem so Japanese . Auralee, Comoli, and Kaptain Sunshine lead this second wave. They’re sold in stores alongside Lemaire , Margaret Howell , and The Row , and fit in well with the aesthetics of those brands. The second wave has the tasteful, culturally anonymous appeal of the flattened global chicness that emerged around 2020. Courtesy of Unlikely Dry Goods Courtesy of Unlikely Dry Goods The second and third waves now coexist, but rarely overlap. You don’t see Kapital next to Auralee in stores, nor do you see guys wearing both brands at the same time. But individually they are powerful forces in the current aesthetics of menswear. Meanwhile, between the two, like a rose growing up through a seam between two solid slabs of concrete, a fourth wave is taking shape. This one is different from the previous two, and has emerged for seemingly different reasons. If the second wave is about tradition and history, and the third wave is about tasteful global luxury, the fourth wave is about unique, singular attitudes toward making and wearing clothes. The brands are powered by personal nuance—by nuanced personalities—above all else. They lean into their obsessions, they turn hobbies into products, and they feel designed to appeal to the few. And if one thing is certain in the current, mass-individual menswear moment, it’s that success starts with a niche. The smaller the better. Courtesy of T.T Courtesy of T.T A.Presse may still be relatively small at the moment, but it isn’t likely to stay that way for long. The brand, founded and designed by Kazuma Shigematsu , is what happens when a meticulous vintage collector goes rogue and turns all of his very best pieces into exquisitely crafted super garments. I met Shigematsu in Paris back in June and was astounded by how much design and development he packed into such an unassuming collection—there’s enough silk, cashmere and suede to make an Hermés store blush. A.Presse is currently being sold in a handful of stores outside of Japan, and will receive a proper American launch at Union on October 26 and 27. In a similar vein, Taiga Takahashi makes old-timey clothes that somehow feel exceptionally modern, processed through the lens of an erudite young designer—a very difficult move to pull off. Tragically, the label’s namesake Taiga Hashi died in 2022 at just 27. But the label he started in 2017— shortly after graduating from the prestigious Central Saint Martins fashion program in London—lives on, run by his studio and family. Courtesy of Tightbooth Courtesy of Tightbooth Unlikely Dry Goods might be the most quintessential fourth wave Japanese brand of them all. Designed by Shinsuke Nakata , former creative director of Beams Plus and founder of the tech outdoors label Daiwa Pier39 , Unlikely is a brand with a strong personality, much like its charismatic designer. Nakata is a master of mashing different strains of Americana together in novel ways. Outside of Japan, you can order Unlikely on sites like Coverchord , but next month the brand is hosting a pop-up at Nepenthes New York starting on November 8. This extremely personal approach—letting the unique personality and interests of the designer or the director guide the brand direction—is the new twist here. These brands are fitting into the global good-taste hegemony or dutifully re-creating well-made garms of bygone eras. They’re guided by good vibes and enthusiasm. Setinn is another great example of this. Designed by Shingo Arai , Beams' men's casual buyer, Setinn is a tennis apparel brand based on the ‘90s glory days of big-player fits on and off the court. Tightbooth , which was started as a crew with Japanese skate legend Shinpei Ueno and friends back in 2005, applies a very modern Japanese street-style aesthetic—huge pants, graphic prints, irreverent tailoring —to the relatively static world of skate clothing. And Creek Angler’s Device , which just recently dipped its first toe into international waters with a brief pop-up at Blue in Green , is a streetwear brand disguised as a fly-fishing brand. Or a fly-fishing brand disguised as a streetwear brand. But while most people have never heard of the secretive operation outside of Japan, it still sells out of every product it drops almost instantly. I also have my eye on a couple nano brands that have a very slow and careful approach to making ordinary-looking clothes extraordinary: namely Brochure , by SSZ director Katoh Tadayuki , and Cup & Cone . Courtesy of Setinn Courtesy of Setinn What’s changed in recent years for any Japanese brand is that the price of the yen has fallen significantly relative to the dollar. And the Japanese economy broadly, as I understand it, is struggling. This means more Japanese businesses are looking outside of Japan in ways that they didn’t—or didn’t have to—before. (In case you haven’t noticed, now is a great time to go to Japan and buy, for instance, a Rolex. Or a car.) I’m not an economist, so I can’t say for sure, but it seems obvious that ambitious brands like A.Presse will continue to push hard into the global fashion market. Niche labels like Unlikely and Creek, meanwhile, will find their own international opportunities to grow and sustain while things are slow at home. Fortunately for all of them, the yen may be down, but the Japanese Brand is as strong as ever. So what does this new wave of brands from Japan tell us about the future of menswear? I think we're nearing a point of exhaustion for the global megabrand, the brand that does it all for everyone, the brand that has many faces but no personality. Specificity, enthusiasm, obsessiveness—these are the qualities that people are connecting with right now. And these are human qualities. Things that individuals can project onto clothes, that shoppers can then absorb and make part of their world. Whether or not you're into fly fishing or skateboarding is besides the point. Within these niches there are subcultures . And within subcultures, style flourishes.

As a basis for evaluating markets, we use resources from the Statista platform, national statistics, industry research, market data from independent databases and third-party sources, historical developments, current trends, reported performance indicators from the key market players, and Statista interviews with market experts. Next we use relevant key market indicators and data from country-specific associations such as GDP, consumer spending, consumer price index and population. This data helps us to estimate the market size for each country individually. Forecasts: In our forecasts, we apply diverse forecasting techniques. The selection of forecasting techniques is based on the behavior of the particular market. For example, the exponential trend smoothing illustrates suited forecasting for the Apparel market with projected steady growth. The main drivers are GDP per capita and consumer spending per capita. Additional Notes : The market is updated twice per year in case market dynamics change. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war are considered at a country-specific level.\n",
